				Last Minute Release Notes	-	May 2, 1999
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Even though I have not worked on it in quite a while, I've always wanted to
release the source code to this project.  I just didn't because I did not want
to contribute to the ZBot epidemic (sorry Cube... :P).  However, with Q3A due 
out soon, I think it is safe enough.

Having said that, let me tell you about what you're in for if you want to work
with this source:

	1) It isn't a complete bot.  It's just what I had done so far.
	2) It does work with v3.20
	3) It does not expire.
	4) It's not ready for public consumption.  There are a lot of little things
		I put in while tinkering around strewn though out the code.  I did not
		take the time to go through and clean it all up.
	5) Do not use this code as a good example of MFC.  Yes, I used MFC.  No, I
		didn't do it very well.


I'm mainly releasing this so that the people out there who want to write a bot,
but think that doing it from scratch is too ambitious, have something to start
with.

May the like force be with you or something.
